    2. **Important**: The function that drives one of the challenges is `updateCurrentPage(str)` which takes 1 parameter, a string of the word to display as the current page. This function is not included in the code of the page, along with a few other things, are linked via an external js file. Make sure you do not delete this line.  
5. Create a branch called M3-Challenge-HW if you haven't yet
6. Add this template to that branch (git add/git commit)
7. Make a pull request for this branch once you push it
8. You may manually deploy the HW branch to dev to get the evidence for the below prompts
9. Create a new file **m3_submission.md** file in the hw branch and fill it with the output generated from this page (be careful not to paste more than once)
10. Add, commit, and push the submission file
11. Close the pull request by merging it to dev (double-check all looks good on dev)
12. Manually create a new pull request from dev to prod (i.e., base: prod <- compare: dev)
13. Complete the merge to deploy to production
14. Submit the direct link of the m3_submission.md from the prod branch to Canvas for this submission

<tr><td><table><tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 1: </em> Briefly explain how you made the navigation horizontal</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>I was able to make the navigation horizontal,&nbsp; by setting the value for<br>display inline, which makes it so each of the navigation tabs are in<br>a line and don&#39;t start on new lines. This went in between the<br>nav li bracket because those were the tags sorrounding the list of links.<br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 2: </em> Briefly explain how you remove the navigation list item markers</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>I removed the navigation list item markers, by setting the list-style-type to none.<br>This made it so that there was no style in the list which<br>automatically removed the markers.&nbsp;<br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 3: </em> Briefly explain how you gave the navigation a background</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>The navigation was given a background by setting background-color to an rgb value.<br>This assignment was in the nav brackets.<br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 4: </em> Briefly explain how you made the links (or their surrounding area) change color on mouseover/hover</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>I made the links change color by hovering over them, by creating a<br>new set of brackets titling nav a:hover. This way this part would only<br>be executed when the mouse was hovering over the links. Then inside the<br>brackets, I assigned background color to rgb value of light sky blue.<br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 5: </em> Briefly explain how you changed the challenge list bullet points to checkmarks (âœ“)</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>I changed the list bullet points to checkmarks by creating a bracket for<br>body ul which is where the unordered list of instructions were and I<br>set the list style type equal to a checkmark characher.<br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 6: </em> Briefly explain how you made the first character of the h1 tags and anchor tags uppercased</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>I made the first character of the h1 tags and anchor tags uppercased<br>by creating a bracket for anchor and header 1 and then inside doing<br>text-transform: capitalize..<br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 7: </em> Briefly explain/describe your custom styling of your choice</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>I styled the header 2 of my choice by doing text-align center to<br>get the header centered on the page. THen I changed the font by<br>doing font-family: and then a certian font. I also changed the color of<br>the text by doing color: rgb. Finally I made the text have an<br>outlined shadow by doing text-shadow: 2px 2px.<br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 8: </em> Briefly explain how the styling for the challenge list doesn't impact the navigation list</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>Styling the list doesn&#39;t impact the navigation list because I did this list<br>styling in the body ul whereas the navigation list is located in body<br>li. This ensures that only the code in the unordered list would be<br>affected by this command which was the challenge list.<br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 9: </em> Briefly explain how you updated the content of the h1 tag with the link text</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>I did not get a solution for this. I attempted many solutions including<br>using quereySelector(), getElementAtID(), I tried various times calling the updateCurrentPage() and then setting<br>the value that I got for the link equal to the text of<br>h1 but nothing would work.<br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 10: </em> Briefly explain how you updated the content of the title tag with the link text</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>The same as the other, I did not get a solution for this.<br>I attempted many solutions including using quereySelector(), getElementAtID(), I tried various times calling<br>the updateCurrentPage() and then setting the value that I got for the link<br>equal to the text of the title but nothing would work.<br></p><br></td></tr>

<tr><td><table><tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 1: </em> Comment briefly talking about what you learned and/or any difficulties you encountered and how you resolved them (or attempted to)</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>Honestly, I spent almost 5-6 hours of my day straight just looking at<br>this but I do not think that we learned the sufficient information to<br>complete this assignment. I looked through videos to try and help me with<br>this, and I discovered ways to try and access the link elements once<br>they were clicked including the quereySelector(), getElementById(), getElementByName(), and the document.form[0]. But it<br>seemed as if each of these examples used attributes that weren&#39;t available to<br>us in this assignment because we couldn&#39;t edit the body. I tried to<br>resolve this issue by testing writing the list of links by using onclick=getcurrentSelector(this),<br>and this did work by showing the different link names in the title<br>and h1 tag, but this solution would go against the rules of the<br>HW.<br></p><br></td></tr>
