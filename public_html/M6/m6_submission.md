<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>The function alterSpeed() sets the speed of the left paddle based on the<br>score difference between the right paddle and the left paddle. If the score<br>difference is greater than or equal to 3 in favor of the right<br>paddle, the left paddle speed is set to 6. If the score difference<br>is greater than or equal to 3 in favor of the left paddle,<br>the left paddle speed is set to 1.5. Otherwise, the speed of the<br>left paddle is set to 3. This function changes the hard-coded values of<br>the left paddle speed based on game logic. This means that the speed<br>of the left paddle will be adjusted dynamically during the game based on<br>the score difference, making it easier or harder for the player to control<br>the paddle, depending on their current score.<br></p><br></td></tr>

<tr><td> <em>Caption:</em> <p>It is impossible to show this feature in my game as it relates<br>the changing speed of the paddle.

When the player is able to catch<br>up and be in range of less than 3 points of the right<br>paddle, the speed will go back to 3. <br></p>

<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>During this assignment, I learned how we can change elements of our game<br>by altering values dynamically as the game logic proceeds. I learned the importance<br>of using functions in this type of process, as I could save myself<br>from rewriting multiple lines of code just by using a simple function call.<br>Finally, I learned that making static changes to HTML games truley does not<br>enhance any features if nothing is changing as the game runs.<br></p><br></td></tr>
